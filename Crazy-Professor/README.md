Crazy-Professor

##Description##
He's at it again, the professor at the departmment of Computer Science has posed
a question to all his students knowing that they can't brute-force it. He wants
them to all think about the efficiency of their algorithms and how they could
possibly reduce the execution time.

He posed the problem to his students and then smugly left the room in the
mindest that none of his students would complete the task on time (maybe because
the program would still be running!).

##The Problem##
What is the 1,000,000th number that is not divisible by any prime greater than
20?

##NOTE##
Counting will start from 1. Meaning that the 1,000,000th number is the
1,000,000th number and not the 999,999th number.
