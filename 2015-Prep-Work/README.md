2015 Prep Work
======
####From /u/Coder_d00d####

##Description##
For today's challenge you will be doing some prep work for yourself.

##Tool Development##
Develop a tool or several tools you can use in the coming year for completing
challenges. The tool is up to you. It can be anything that you find you repeat
in your code.

Some basic ideas are:
- Read input from user
- Input from a file
- Output to user
- Output to a file

Do not limit yourself to these. Look at your previous code and find the pieces
of code you repeat a lot and develop your own library for handling that part of
your challenges. Having this for your use will make solutions easier to develop
as you already have that code done.
